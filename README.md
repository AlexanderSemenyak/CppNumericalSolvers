CppOptimizationLibrary (A header-only C++17 optimization library)
=================================================================

It has been now 6 years since the initial release. I did some mistakes in the previous design of this library and some features felt a bit ad-hoc. Given that C++14 is around and C++17 will become mainstream, I will take the opportunity to correct some of these mistakes and simplify things here in this v2-branch.

This branch is under development.

Have you ever looked for a C++ function *fminsearch*, which is easy to use without adding tons of dependencies and without editing many setting-structs and without dependencies?

Want a full example?

```cpp
    using Problem = Function<double, /*Order*/ 1, /*InputDim*/ 2>;
    class Rosenbrock : public Problem {
      public:

        using vector_t = typename Problem::vector_t;
        using scalar_t = typename Problem::scalar_t;

        scalar_t operator()(const vector_t &x) {
            const scalar_t t1 = (1 - x[0]);
            const scalar_t t2 = (x[1] - x[0] * x[0]);
            return   t1 * t1 + 100 * t2 * t2;
        }
    };
    int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {

        using Function = Rosenbrock;
        using Solver = cppoptlib::solver::Bfgs<Function>;

        Function f;
        Function::vector_t x(2);
        x << -1, 2;

        // Evaluate
        auto state = f.Eval(x);
        std::cout << f(x) << " = " << state.value << std::endl;
        std::cout << state.x << std::endl;
        std::cout << state.gradient << std::endl;
        std::cout << state.hessian << std::endl;


        std::cout << cppoptlib::utils::IsGradientCorrect(f, x) << std::endl;
        std::cout << cppoptlib::utils::IsHessianCorrect(f, x) << std::endl;

        Solver solver;

        auto[solution, solver_state] = solver.minimize(f, x);
        std::cout << "argmin " << solution.x.transpose() << std::endl;
        std::cout << "f in argmin " << solution.value << std::endl;
        std::cout << "iterations " << solver_state.num_iterations << std::endl;
        std::cout << "solver status " << solver_state.status << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
```

To use another solver, simply replace `BfgsSolver` by another name.

# Changes

- Instead of nesting information in each class, this implementation will handle and update states of functions and solvers.
- This will follow clang-format google-code-style and will be compliant cpplint.
- This will drop Support for TensorFlow and Matlab (maybe Python will be an option).
